Hi, I'm Aditya.

I’m a pre-final year undergraduate student at National Institute of Technology Hamirpur, Himachal Pradesh, currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering.

I’m passionate about developing products that make people's lives easier. I'm fascinated by backend development and these days, I’m working on polishing my programming & web development skills.
